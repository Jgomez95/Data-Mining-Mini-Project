Project for data mining class

## Steps to compile from the cmd line
1. cd into the src filez
To compile the code use
2. javac Classify.java
The program assumes you have a folder which contains 2 folders, data and train.<br/>
If you have a folder `C:\User\Desktop\data` it assumes you have a subfolder 
`C:\User\Desktop\data\test` and `C:\User\Desktop\data\train` inside the data folder.
3. java Classify NB [Directory path]

When testing from the CMD line, KNN gives a memory heap out error :(
